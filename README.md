My machine learning model is intended to predict the death toll magnitude resulting from an earthquake. My hypothesis is that earthquakes occurring near populous areas are more likely to result in a loss of life than those with epicenters in unpopulated areas, and when those populated areas have underdeveloped infrastructure, the risk of fatalities is exacerbated. 

When used as a simulation tool, this model can assist local governments in identifying earthquake-vulnerable regions or cities, and thus aid in deciding where investments in earthquake preparedness should be made.
