# Data1030_Project

Repository for my DATA1030 ML Project.
I use packages that are not included in the class data1030 conda environment, so if you wish to run the code that blends my raster files with the earthquake data- Data_Blending.ipynb-
please use the provided .yml file to create a new environment beforehand. 

If you only want to run the EDA notebook- EDA_Preprocess_ntbk.ipynb- there is no need to create a new environment. That notebook uses blended_quake_data.csv as the input, which is the output file of the blending notebook.
